# Health-Substance Abuse Data Analysis

## Introduction
The healthcare sector, a crucial industry dedicated to enhancing people's overall well-being, is making noteworthy advancements. This project specifically concentrates on studying data related to substance abuse through the utilization of PowerBI, a strong tool for visualizing data.

## Brief
This report aims to examine hospitalization programs, key factors driving primary mental health diagnoses, substances commonly abused, and demographic patterns associated with mental health diagnoses. The goal is to identify the most efficient program and assess its effectiveness variations based on gender, ethnicity, and age.

**_Client Requirements_**:
- The report should be brief, restricted to a maximum of one to two pages.
- The client do not want an Intro Page but suggests instead vertical/horizontal navigation bars or pop-up menu.
- The report should not be scrollable or fancy shaped, and  the report must fit well within a page. Preferred size 16:9.

## Insights
 The dataset has details about different treatment plans, including **Usual Care** and **Intervention programs**. The analysis showed that:
1. Enrollment in Usual Care programs is more prevalent among individuals seeking treatment, comprising 70% of the patient population, whereas Intervention programs cater to 30% of individuals, primarily those with milder substance abuse issues seeking treatment.
2. There was no statistically significant distinction in the effectiveness between usual care and intervention care. However, there was a notable overall improvement in the DLA-20 scores for intervention care.
3. The Psychosis medical condition showed the most improvement in DLA.
4. The Alcohol Sustance showed the most improvement in DLA.
5. Most hospital admissions are the 30-49 age group.
6. Alcohol abuse and the medical condition of psychosis resulted in the highest number of hospital admissions, establishing them as the primary factors driving primary mental health diagnoses.

## Conclusion
This project allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills to analyze real-life health data. The analysis revealed the potential success of a new intervention program and highlighted the gender and age group that responded well to the treatment. PowerBI was a useful tool for displaying the data visually, and I am eager to use it in upcoming data analysis projects.
